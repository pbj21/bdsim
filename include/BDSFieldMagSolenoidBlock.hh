/**
 * @brief Class that provides the magnetic field due to a square annulus of current.
 *
 * Looking in the z,r plane we would see two square blocks with an inner edge at +-r
 * and centered at z = 0. In r, the square extends from innerRadiusIn to innerRadiusIn+radialThicknessIn.
 * There is a +- this in r with the top one being the sign of the strength and the bottom one
 * being the return of the annulus with current in the opposite direction. In phi, it is circular.
