/**
 * @brief Factory class for outer volume of magnets. 
 *
 * Produces magnets
 * with 2N-poles around the beampipe with a faceted yoke - the yoke 
 * is perpendiular to the pole direction where the pole joins the yoke.
 * Between each pole there is a flat section angled between the two poles
 * 
 * Most magnets are 2N poles, but sector- and r-bends as well as 
 * muon spoilers, and h/v kickers are unique.
